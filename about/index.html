<p>This is not the first blog that the author tried to maintain. However, without enough motivation, none of the previous attempts pulled off. With a new factor, I truly hope this site will live as long as possible. It is also a good gauge for a professional researcher to maintain his passion and habit of thinking and reflecting.</p>
<h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
<p>Thanks to the Bocconi University and its generous scholarship <code>unibocconi.eu</code>, the author has been able to finish his 31-month study in Europe, across Italy and the Netherlands. He is also lucky to experience the life in Singapore and Australia. Hopefully these experiences have been stirred and mixed with his early life in China.</p>
<h1 id="research">Research</h1>
<p>The author has been trying, though no harder than most other researchers, to be an excellent researcher. As part of the effort, the site will document most of his personal projects. Sincerely, all errors are my own. This site and I says &ldquo;Cogito ergo sum&rdquo;.</p>

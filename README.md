## 源起
工作之后，我在工作和生活上都时不时有一些心得体会，觉得如果有机会可以和大家分享，应能帮到一些朋友。另一方面，自诩以写R为生的我，也觉得自己享受开源社区久矣，有必要找个地方回报大家，于是就有了这样一个Github库。

## Motivation
After graduation, I often feel it's necessary to keep communicating with friends and colleagues and I do feel some of my experience would help. One the other hand, as a self-esteemed R user, I have enjoyed the idea of sharing long enough to retribute. So I build this repository.

      <description>The following proofs are referenced from Eisenberg, Larry, and Thomas H. Noe. 2001. “Systemic Risk in Financial Systems.” Management Sci- ence 47 (2): 236–49.
Proofs from the original paper Existence of Payment Equilibrium (Theorem 1) Theorem 1. Corresponding to every financial system $$(\Pi, \bar{p}, e)$$ a. There exists a greatest and least clearing payment vector.
b. under all clearing vectors, the value of the equity at each node of the financial system is the same, that is, if p&#39; and p&#39;&#39; are any two clearing vectors, $$(\Pi^T(p&#39;)+e - \bar{p})^+=(\Pi^T(p&#39;&#39;)+e - \bar{p})^+$$</description>

 Rob J Hyndman&amp;rsquo;s personal website. Live Free or Dichotomize by Lucy and Nick et al.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be more.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>
      <link>/post/2016/02/14/a-plain-markdown-post/</link>

      <guid>/post/2016/02/14/a-plain-markdown-post/</guid>
      <description>This sample post is mainly for blogdown users. If you do not use blogdown, you can skip the first section.
1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>

      <description>This is not the first blog that the author tried to maintain. However, without enough motivation, none of the previous attempts pulled off. With a new factor, I truly hope this site will live as long as possible. It is also a good gauge for a professional researcher to maintain his passion and habit of thinking and reflecting.
Experience Thanks to the Bocconi University and its generous scholarship unibocconi.eu, the author has been able to finish his 31-month study in Europe, across Italy and the Netherlands.</description>

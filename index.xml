      <description>The following proofs are referenced from Eisenberg, Larry, and Thomas H. Noe. 2001. “Systemic Risk in Financial Systems.” Management Sci- ence 47 (2): 236–49.
Proofs from the original paper Existence of Payment Equilibrium (Theorem 1) Theorem 1. Corresponding to every financial system \[(\Pi, \bar{p}, e)\] a. There exists a greatest and least clearing payment vector.
under all clearing vectors, the value of the equity at each node of the financial system is the same, that is, if p’ and p’’ are any two clearing vectors, \[(\Pi^T(p&amp;#39;)+e - \bar{p})^+=(\Pi^T(p&amp;#39;&amp;#39;)+e - \bar{p})^+\]  Proof.</description>

      <description>This is not the first blog that the author tried to maintain. However, without enough motivation, none of the previous attempts pulled off. With a new factor, I truly hope this site will live as long as possible. It is also a good gauge for a professional researcher to maintain his passion and habit of thinking and reflecting.
Experience Thanks to the Bocconi University and its generous scholarship unibocconi.eu, the author has been able to finish his 31-month study in Europe, across Italy and the Netherlands.</description>

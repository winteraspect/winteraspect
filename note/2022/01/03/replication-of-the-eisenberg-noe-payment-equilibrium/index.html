<p>The following proofs are referenced from Eisenberg, Larry, and Thomas H. Noe. 2001. “Systemic Risk in Financial Systems.” Management Sci- ence 47 (2): 236–49.</p>
<h1 id="proofs-from-the-original-paper">Proofs from the original paper</h1>
<h2 id="existence-of-payment-equilibrium-theorem-1">Existence of Payment Equilibrium (Theorem 1)</h2>
<p>Theorem 1. Corresponding to every financial system $$(\Pi, \bar{p}, e)$$
a. There exists a greatest and least clearing payment vector.</p>
<p>b. under all clearing vectors, the value of the equity at each node of the financial system is the same, that is, if p' and p'' are any two clearing vectors, $$(\Pi^T(p')+e - \bar{p})^+=(\Pi^T(p'')+e - \bar{p})^+$$</p>
<p>Proof. To prove theorem 1, we need to fist characterize some basic basic properties of the $\Phi$ map. We note that $\Phi$ is postive, increasing, concave and nonexpansive. The assertions of positivity, monotonicity and concavity follow because $\Phi$ is the composition of the positive, incraesing, affine map $q \rightarrow   \Pi^Tq + e$, and the positive , increasing, concave map $q \rightarrow   q\wedge\bar{p}$. Then by contraction thereom, we could find the fixed point and possibly a unique one.</p>
<p>Previously, the author has characterize the clearing payment vector as $$p_i^* = min[e_i+\Sigma^N_{i=1}\Pi_{ij}^Tp_j^*,\bar{p_i}]$$
This is where we might find the contraction we need. Using a more concise notation, the author defined $\Phi$ as $$\Phi(p; \Pi, \bar{p}, e) \equiv (\Pi^Tp+e)\wedge\bar{p}$$</p>
<p>The proof is then finished by Tarski fixed-point theorem. (a) is proved.</p>
<p>To prove (b), the author showed that the value of equity is the same under different payment equilibrium. Remeber $e_i$ is defined as the exogenous operating cash flow received by node i. The $\bar{p}$ represents the upper limit of the payment, which are the debt matrix.</p>
<h2 id="uniqueness-of-payment-equilibrium-theorem-2">Uniqueness of Payment Equilibrium (Theorem 2)</h2>
<p>To give a condition for the uniqueness of the equilibrium, the authors realize that the value of equity does not leave the closed <em>risk orbit</em>。The authors define the regular financial system to be a network where every risk orbit is a surplus set.</p>
<p>The condition to test if an orbit is a surplus set is that</p>
<ol>
<li>The nodes in the set have not obligations to nodes outsiede the set.</li>
<li>The set has positive aggregated operating cash flows.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, the risk orbit is just a same <strong>closed</strong> set without the <strong>surplus</strong> feature.</p>
